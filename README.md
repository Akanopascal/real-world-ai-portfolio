## 📌 Component Overview

### 1️⃣ Customer Spending & Churn Prediction (Streaming Service)
- **Goal:** Predict customer monthly spend, identify churners, and segment users.
- **Models:** Linear & Polynomial Regression, Random Forest, ANN, SVM, KNN, K-Means, DBSCAN
- **Best results:** 
  - 🧠 ANN for regression (R² = 0.8854, RMSE = 3.22)
  - 🌲 Random Forest for churn (F1 = 0.9815)
  - 🔍 K-means for segmentation (Silhouette Score = 0.52)

### 2️⃣ Vehicle Damage Classification (Insurance Verification)
- **Goal:** Detect damage type from images to automate insurance claims.
- **Models:** CNN, Tuned CNN, MobileNetV2 (Transfer Learning)
- **Best result:** 
  - 📷 MobileNetV2: Accuracy = 91%, F1-score ≥ 0.85 on all classes

### 3️⃣ Explainable AI in Precision Agriculture (Ethics)
- **Goal:** Critically assess ethical challenges in using AI for smart farming.
- **Topics:** Counterfactual explanations, SHAP, Trustworthy AI, domain-specific visualisation pipelines
